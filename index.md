## Professional Experience

### BNP PARIBAS Cardif, **Data Scientist Intern**  
- *April 2023 - September 2023*
  - Developed and implemented advanced OCR models tailored to accurately recognize handwritten and digital text
within scanned documents, resulting in a 40% improvement in recognition accuracy..
  - Utilized state-of-the-art models to optimize system performance and reduce inference time..
  - Developed text-to-image generation models employing latent diffusion models and GANs for handwritten image
generation, resulting in a significant boost of model performance.
  - Integrated the developed solution into the existing Intelligent Document Processing pipeline, enhancing
document processing efficiency by adding support for handwritten documents.

### Zaion, **Data Scientist Intern**  
- *February 2022 - August 2022*
  - Developed a robust method for predicting wait times in call center queues using sequence models, including RNN, LSTM, and TCN.
  - Implemented a sequence modeling approach for wait-time prediction, resulting in a remarkable 50% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - Utilized Monte Carlo Dropout to assess and quantify the uncertainty of predictive models.
  - Applied BERT-based models to predict customer churn by analyzing textual data from client-bot conversations.

### RTE, **Data Scientist Intern**  
- *May 2021 - October 2021*
  - Designed an algorithm to estimate the risk of failures in electrical grid components by leveraging machine
learning and statistical techniques.
  - Developed a robust algorithm for calculating failure risk for various grid components, contributing to more informed decision-making and proactive maintenance strategies.
  - Created an interactive web application to facilitate user-friendly utilization of the risk estimation algorithm, enhancing accessibility and usability for stakeholders.

- **RIG-Chess - Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals (RIG) for Chess**: Unsupervised representation learning and reinforcement learning of goal-conditioned policies applied to the game of chess. A generative model, VAE, is used to generate chess configurations that will serve as goals that the agent is going to try and reach.
